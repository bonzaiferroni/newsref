Only follow links from news articles. These will be:
	1. Links to news articles
	2. Links to news sources
	3. Non-relevant links
	
My crawler wants to follow through to 1 and 2 and not 3. It wants to read articles and verify the link on sources.

Some sites won't load, should it try to handle those?
