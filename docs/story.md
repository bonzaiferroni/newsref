Dear Mom and Dad,

I've spent my life studying people, even before I went to college. In the little book of pictures of the time I visited the ranch, Leslie writes that I asked many questions, wanting to know about the things we do. I've carried this curiosity my whole life, reading every kind of book and getting a doctorate's worth of education on the subject and beyond.

What have I learned? I have a vague and incomplete understanding of a number of things, the human experience is rich and deep and hard to fathom. But a few truths have risen to the surface and seem to bob there, steady and true even after I lose sight of them. Among these faithful gifts there is one that stands out to me now, and that is the importance of stories to our lives.

Nothing captures our attention like a story, and for good reason. We need stories like we need a map, they let us see where we've been, they help us imagine where we'd like to go. Another person's story is no less valuable to us than our own, they help understand our own path. Only after hearing many stories can we begin to draw in our minds a map of life, to guide us and to share.

There is a curious relationship between story and truth. Sometimes we use the word "story" to mean something less than true, and this might be the case depending on the story. But stories also have the power to be something deeper than the basic facts, to shine a light on truth that might not otherwise stand out. A story invites us to understand what happened from another perspective, to take a journey in someone's shoes. Along the way we see what they see, feel as they feel, grow as they grow.

On your Golden Anniversary I told the story of how you met and fell in love and started a life together. It was a joy to explore and tell, the story of your life and love is beautiful by any measure, and even more so to me, your son. An anniversary is a moment to celebrate the good parts of the story, and yet we also all recognize that there is more to the Bollwerk story than the good parts, and that is saying it gently. 

What happens when we only tell the good parts of the story? The maps we draw from it will leave out some of the most important parts. They will not lead us away from moments of despair and misery, perhaps even guiding us directly there.

As we have lived out our story, a great many things were never said, important truths never told, help never received. We have shown only the good parts of the Bollwerk story. Our silence came partly from fear and partly from shame. We also do not wish to hurt the people we love. But our silence has hurt us far more than we have understood. I cannot bear to follow that path any longer.

I have tried several times to write our story. I believe it is important for all the reasons I've explored. There are also beautiful parts that I long to convey, and to look upon the story as a whole as beautiful. But each time I try, bitterness and pain rise to the surface. Our story as a whole is not beautiful, not from where we are at in the story, and not told by me.

If I were to tell it, it would go like this: Two teenagers meet and find a love that lifts them up, a love they carry together for a lifetime. In each other they hold the kind of dedication we hear about in fairy tales, and it doesn't come from magic but from the simple choice to hold true to each other and their promise, each time things get rough. And things get rough.

Bubby is handsome and smart, good with his hands, good with machines. The kind of man who rises to a challenge, who sees nothing as beyond him, and who hates to pay someone else for something he can do himself. He had few people he could depend on and became someone anyone can depend on.

Brenda is free spirited and beautiful, loves horses and dancing, rejoices in virtue and truth. She doesn't do anything the way others think that she should when she knows a better way. She has a spirit of youthfulness, cheerful and patient and kind, that will follow her all her days. She wishes above all things to be a mother.

Together, they discover a deeper meaning to life in the Bible. They feel a warmth and love from beyond and find answers there to the burdens of the soul. They recognize the power of church and community and dedicate their lives to service.

Their young lives were full of travel, they lived in many places. They had friends and adventures and also a growing uneasiness that they had not become pregnant. Eventually their prayers were answered, and a new chapter of life began. 

Bubby is capable of great gentleness, but that is not his first instinct. Much further down the road, she would describe him to her son like this: "You know how some people, when you accidentally bump into them while crossing the room, might put their arm out to steady or reassure you? Al is the kind of person who will bump you right back." 

When his spirit is light, he is a joy to be around, sometimes the life of the party. He would pull the neighborhood kids on their sled with his car.

You each have expressed in various ways a disappointment in the lack of receptiveness to the wisdom and knowledge and experience that life has taught you. There is another thing that I have learned while studying people. There are at least two kinds of wisdom, the kind we thought we had all along that other people don't appreciate quite enough, and the kind that we only receive after we put down the first kind and actually listen to what life is trying to tell us. If it isn't at least a little painful, we might be off track.
