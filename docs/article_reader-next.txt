Some articles are not associated with a physical location, for example, they might be about something that happened online. In that case, answer "no location".

## Event Title
Following is a list of current events. Does this article focus on any of these events? If so, provide the name of the event exactly as it appears in the list. If you are unable to find the event that is the topic of the article in the list, provide a new title that describes the event. As the title of the event, it should simply say what happened, based on the information you gather from the article. It should be no more than 100 characters long and include only the most relevant details. Shorter is better.

It should have a subject and a verb. This is a bad example of a title because it has no verb:
Ukraine War & US Political Reactions

A better title would be this:
US Politicians React to Ukraine War

The title should be objective and avoid taking the opinions of the headlines when it may be open for debate. This is a bad title because it is subjective:
Musk misused federal data, causing government turmoil

Here is a better title that maintains a neutral perspective while capturing the details of the event:
Musk allegedly misuses federal data, causing government turmoil

Here are more examples of good titles:

Plane crashes outside of Topeka, Kansas
Trump signs executive order on immigration
Tree falls on garbage truck in Denver

Here is the list of possible events that you may choose from if it is the focus of the article, otherwise create a new title:

<|possible_events|>

## Objectivity Indicators

Provide exactly five statements from the article that indicate its level of objectivity. For each statement, provide a single sentence exactly as it appears in the article and a ranking between 1 and 5, with higher values indicating more objectivity and lower values indicating low objectivity. Do not pick just any statement, it must be relevant to the main points of the article. Use the following rubric:

A statement ranked as 5 indicates high objectivity. The statement is made with a neutral perspective, providing only relevant facts without additional commentary. It does not try to persuade or offer opinions, although it may report the perspectives and opinions of the people involved.

A statement ranked as 3 indicates medium objectivity. It may offer an opinion or interpretation influenced by personal judgment but also provides supporting evidence. It may try to persuade but offers reasonable justification.

A statement ranked as 1 indicates low objectivity. It offers opinions and assumptions as if they are objectively true, without providing support. This can be difficult to identify because the author might use a tone of factual authority. You must consider the objective integrity or intent of the author and whether the information provided can be objectively offered or if it is inherently subjective.
