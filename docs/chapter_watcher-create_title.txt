Here are a list of headlines that may be related to a news event.
<|headlines|>

For the title property of your json response, generate a single title for the event, based on the headlines. As the title of the event, it should simply say what happened, based on the information you gather from the headlines. It should be no more than 100 characters long and include only the most relevant details. Shorter is better.

It should have a subject and a verb. This is a bad example of a title because it has no verb:
Ukraine War & US Political Reactions

A better title would be this:
US Politicians React to Ukraine War

Here are more examples of good titles:

Plane crashes outside of Topeka, Kansas
Trump signs executive order on immigration
Tree falls on garbage truck in Denver
