I have a list of known people and a news article. For each different name in the list, make a determination whether they are likely to be the person referenced by the article, based on your knowledge, the given identifiers, and the content from the article. Some names might appear more than once in the list, referencing different people. Choose the person from the table that best fits with the person discussed by the article. Only return one id per name.

Provide your responses in this format: id:name

The following is an invalid response because it has only a name, no id:

* John Smith

The following is a set of invalid responses because it contains more than one indication per name:

* 2115:John Smith
* 5235:John Smith

The following is a set of valid responses because each entry has both an id and a unique name:

* 215:Kathryn Janeway
* 42612:Jean-Luc Picard
* 324:James Kirk
* 5515:Benjamin Sisko

Here is the table of individuals and their identifiers:

Here is the article content:
